<h2>Description</h2>

**A number sorting program that offers a selection of sorting algorithms and a randomly generated array of numbers to sort.**

---

<h3>Sorting Algorithms Used:</h3>

- Bubble Sort

This algorithm uses array iteration through a for loop to compare the value of two adjacent values and swaps them accordingly until all elements are in chronological order.

- Insertion Sort

This algorithm uses recursion to compare the values of adjacent elements and swaps them accordingly until all elements are in chronological order.

- Binary Tree Sort

This algorithm uses a binary tree to sort elements. Upon sorting the tree it is recursively traversed returning the elements in chronological order.

<h3>Testing and Performance:</h3>

- Testing

Included are JUnit test files for all sorting classes and for the RandomGenerator class.

- Performance

It also includes performance testing using System.nanoTime to track time taken to run methods. This is checked against varying array sizes up to 1000.
